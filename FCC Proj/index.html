            <h3><strong>About Us</strong></h3>
            <p>We are a small group of hard working people with vision and purpose. We are committed to growing and
                improving our ability to stand out among our peers and competitors in the areas of product variety and
                customer service. We look forward to working with you.</p>

            <h3><strong>Care and Maintenance</strong></h3>
            <p>Statues with designs that may retain or collect water should be covered or stored. They are also
                susceptible to damage by effects of ice and wind. We strongly suggest that all portable statues be taken
                indoors in extremely inclement weather and freezing temperatures.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3><strong>Shipping Services</strong></h3>
            <p>Shipping statues is an important service. Our goal is to get your statue to you without damage;
                therefore, extra attention must be paid to packaging and shipping of statuary not ordinarily found in
                shipping of other goods.</p>
